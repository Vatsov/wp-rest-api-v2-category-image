== Description ==

Support and Requests please in [GitHub](https://github.com/Vatsov/wp-rest-api-v2-custom-post-fields).  

== Installation ==

This plugin requires having [WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/ "WP REST API") and [Category and Taxonomy Image](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-custom-taxonomy-image/ "Category and Taxonomy Image") installed and activated or it won't be of any use.  

* **Manual Installation:**  
Unzip into your /wp-content/plugins/ directory. If you're uploading it make sure to upload the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in /wp-content/plugins/.

* **Better Installation:**  
Go to Plugins > Add New in your WordPress admin and search for 'WP REST API V2 Custom Post Fields'.

Once installed, activate 'WP REST API V2 Custom Post Fields' from WordPress plugins dashboard page and you're ready to go.

This plugin works straight out of the box.
